# 6502Emu
MOS 6502 microprocessor emulator I created, it is intended to be a part of a larger project namely an Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator.

Since this is a part of another project, it has a pretty minimal Curses user interface, so don't expect any fancy graphics, if you want some edit the main.c file yourself.
